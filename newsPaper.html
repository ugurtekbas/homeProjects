              <p>
                  At the start of the school after the summer vacation on Thursday,

                  Hamburg's schoolchildren
                  and teachers in the buildings of secondary
                  schools should now wear mouth-nose protection - at least outside of class.
                  Hamburg's school senator Ties Rabe (SPD) said this on Monday morning in
                  an interview with NDR 90.3.

                <h2>Mask only when sitting down
                </h2>
              <p>
                  Only when the students sit down in the classrooms at their place
                   of work or <span id="dots">...</span>

                   when teachers sit at their place of work does the mask
                   requirement cease to apply. "But on the paths, in the school corridors,
                   in the breaks, the masks are to be worn without exception," said Rabe.
                   However, this does not apply to elementary school students up to ten
                   years of age. The risk of infection is significantly lower for them.
                   In addition, they could not yet handle the masks properly.
